This folder contains the ~~raw problem files and~~ timing results as used in [A
parallel approach to bi-objective integer
programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.08920).

Code used to run these tests is stored under the tag [bi-objective-timings](https://github.com/WPettersson/moip_aira/releases/tag/bi-objective-timings)

Raw problem files are rather large, and so not currently stored here. Email me if you need access, otherwise I am looking for a place to upload them.
